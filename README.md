# COMPSYS726-AI-literature-review experiment

This project investigates 7 activation functions used in machine learning,
namely: linear, sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, ELU, SELU, softplus

To generate the runtime results from the report,
read through the "FuncPlot.m" file and run it.

To generate the result for convergence,
run "experiment.m".

To generate the result for accuracy,
run "accuracyTest.m"

N.B. before running the file, make sure the data folder's path is included.
